# R Markdown

R markdown has three components: `to force the new line, I added 2 spaces at the end`  
1. metadata (between 2 `---` at top of document)  
2. text (of any kind, anywhere)  
3. and code, surrounded by 3 backticks for a code chunk, or a single backtick for inline calculations (2x2=`r 2*2`).  

R Markdown syntax is Pandoc Markdown. For help on all the options, check the [pandoc user guide](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html).

### Basics of YAML
The YAML ("YAML ain't markup language") header is picky about formatting, including indentation. Use examples or go to a reference to solve more complicated problems. (see [bookdown.org](www.bookdown.org) for lots of info). The `keep_md: true` option is nice for hosting on github as the .md renders nicely there.

### Table of contents
Can be floating or not, several other options.

### Themes
Specify the theme or set it to null and point to a .css document.

### Figures
Can specify `fig_width`, `fig_height`, `fig_caption`, `dev`.

### data frame output
Set the `df_print` option to: kable, tibble, paged

### Code folding
Can include code, but have it hidden by default by setting html_document, `code_folding: hide`

### Templates
See documentation, but this allows for customization of html, latex, pdf, word, etc. such that the markdown text is rendered to preset formatting guidelines. 

## Text

Again, this is the stuff you are writing to either _document_ your **analyses** or discuss them (for example, in a paper). 

Some help with text: To add an image, use `![**Figure 1**. Nice beetle.](figures/bug.jpeg)`: 

![**Figure 1**. Nice beetle.](figures/bug.jpeg)

> "Not everyone likes bugs, but I do."
> 
> -- famous entomologist

Inline latex based equations! $f(k) = \circ p^k 1-p_n + 2$ (And it updates a box showing you the equation in real time!)

## Code

Can be r, python, and many others an you can control whether the code shows, the output shows, or both.
Specify options for code chunks in the curly brackets opening the chunk. Some useful ones: `collapse=TRUE` will make the code and the output format into the same block (see cars example below), `eval=TRUE` will actually evaluate the code (vs not for header type info), `echo=TRUE` will echo the source code in the output document (so you can sometimes only show results or both code and output), `include=FALSE` to not include anything from the code chunk in the output (but if eval is true, the code will still be executed; good for setup stuff?)

# Compile
Using the knit button or Ctrl-Shift-K.  

This renders in a new R session ... a very important point because it means that anything in the console from the previous session is now gone. This is a good thing, related to why you shouldn't save your .Rhistory as it can lead to issues with reproducibility.  

You can also render via the command-line or a script, giving you the ability to have automated report generation but you have to worry about reproducibility in that case.

```{r cars, collapse=TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Shared options
To share options across documents within a directory, include a file named `_output.yml` in the directory (the file will have standard YAML syntax but without the opening and closing `---`). All documents within that directory will then inherit yaml settings from that file, with any specifications in an individual file overriding or adding to those "baseline" specifications.

# PDF output 
A bit different because many of the YAML options are top-level rather than underneath the pdf_output line

You can also have includes underneath the pdf_document option, to put bits of tex at the head, before body, and after body sections of a "document", and you can replace the template with your own template using that option.
